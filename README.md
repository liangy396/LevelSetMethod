1. "Copper_complex.mp4" shows how the method works with complex copper data and shapes.You can see significant geometrical and topological changes. Link: https://github.com/liangy396/LevelSetMovies/blob/master/Copper_complex.mp4

2. "yellow_litho_movie.mp4" shows the movie of another lithology with the copper data. Link: https://github.com/liangy396/LevelSetMovies/blob/master/yellow_litho_movie.mp4

3. "section.mp4" shows the section view of the copper data simulation. Link: https://github.com/liangy396/LevelSetMovies/blob/master/section.mp4
